.gitignore is a configuration file used in version control systems, like Git, to specify files or directories that should be ignored and not tracked. It's important because it helps prevent irrelevant files (e.g., build artifacts, temporary files) or private files from being included in the version history. This keeps the repository clean, reduces unnecessary commits, maintains privacy and ensures that only essential files are shared and tracked, improving collaboration and project organization.
