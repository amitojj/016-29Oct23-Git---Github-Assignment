Version control is a system that tracks changes to code over time, allowing multiple developers to collaborate on a project. It helps manage different versions of the code, facilitates collaboration, and provides a history of changes. This is crucial in software development for tracking progress, identifying and fixing issues, and ensuring a stable codebase.
